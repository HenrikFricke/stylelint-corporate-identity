## Usage

Install the package:

```bash
yarn add stylelint-corporate-identity --dev
# OR
npm i stylelint-corporate-identity --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to your [stylelint configuration](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration/) and define the rule:

```json
{
    "plugins": ["stylelint-corporate-identity"],
    "rules": {
        "corporate-identity/colors": [[ "black", "white" ]]
    }
}
```

In this case the colors `black` and `white` are the colors for the corporate identity.

Run stylelint and get output like this:

```bash
$ stylelint "styles.css"

styles.css
 17:12  âœ–  Expected CSS property "color" to match colors of CI.   corporate-identity/colors
```
